We'd like you to showcase your skills by creating a smart search feature for all free
courses on Analytics Vidhya’s platform: Analytics Vidhya Free Courses(https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/collections/courses).
Your task is to build a Smart Search tool that easily helps users find the most relevant
free courses.

Here’s what you need to do:
1. Browse through the free courses on the platform: Explore and collect data (e.g.,
course titles, descriptions, curriculum) from the free courses available on Analytics
Vidhya platform.

2. Develop a smart search system: Build a search tool that quickly finds and suggests
the most relevant courses using keywords and natural language queries. You should
use Generative AI methods/tools like vector embeddings for querying and an LLM to get
the results.

3. Deploy the tool on Huggingface Spaces: Once your search tool is ready, deploy it on
Huggingface Spaces. You can use any framework (such as Gradio, Streamlit, or others)
as long as it is publicly accessible via Huggingface Spaces.

4. Share the link for review: Provide us with the public link to your deployed smart
search tool for evaluation.

5. Share your approach: Share with us a document (e.g. docx, pdf, etc.) that explains
how you have approached the problem, and the methodology behind the embedding
model and LLM selection.

The more advanced and effective your search tool is, the better your chances of
standing out.
We’re excited to see what you create!
